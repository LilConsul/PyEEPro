# [WIP] Smart Meters in London â€“ Data Analysis Project
## Authors: Shevchenko Denys & Karabanov Yehor
## Overview

This project analyzes the **"Smart Meters in London"** dataset from Kaggle, aiming to uncover insights about energy consumption patterns across London households. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), the analysis addresses time-based trends, consumer behavior, and the influence of weather on energy use. The findings are presented both as a Jupyter Notebook (with code and visualizations) and a comprehensive report.

- **Dataset**: [Smart Meters in London on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london)
- **Objective**: Extract meaningful insights for energy providers, policymakers, and consumers regarding electricity usage patterns in London.

## Project Goals

1. **Dataset Description**  
   - Understand the structure, variables, and scope of the dataset.
   - Identify and handle missing data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze energy usage trends by hour, day, week, and season.
   - Compare consumption between weekdays and weekends.
   - Examine differences between high and low consumers.
   - Investigate the impact of different tariff types (e.g., Standard vs. Economy-7).
   - Explore the relationship between weather (e.g., temperature) and energy use.

3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   - Address missing values and outliers.
   - Resample and aggregate data (e.g., hourly to daily).
   - Engineer new features (e.g., peak hours, seasonal indicators).

4. **Insights & Findings**  
   - Identify peak consumption periods and seasonal usage patterns.
   - Detect anomalies or unusual consumption days.
   - Assess correlations between weather, user groups, and energy consumption.

5. **Visualizations**  
   - Produce line plots, heatmaps, and box plots to illustrate findings.
   - Ensure all visualizations are clear, well-labeled, and support key insights.

6. **Reporting**  
   - Summarize methodology, findings, and potential applications in a concise PDF report.
   - Deliver reproducible code (Jupyter Notebook or .py file) for transparency.
